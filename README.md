TSM is a Windows program written in AutoHotKey specifically for managing signups and messaging during Worm Olympics tournaments.
* More convenient way to gather and store information about participants;
* Automatically generates a list of players and their number (and copies the list of players into clipboard);
* Some common messages that are used to inform participants about signups stuff;
* It is not a pairing tool.

Before using the program, you must enter your MOD nickname, name of a tournament, link to a webpage and channel in order for messages to be displayed correctly. Here's an example of messages:

> * Xrayez ==== Welcome to Worm Olympics Rumble and Ramble tournament! To sign up, send a message to MOD`Xrayez your nickname, clan (or no clan), country and whether you can host. For more information about the tourney, visit http://wormolympics.com/t1918
> * Xrayez ==== Worm Olympics Rumble and Ramble tournament starts now in #RopersHeaven, join!
> * Xrayez ==== List of players: Xrayez (1)
> * Xrayez ==== Don't forget to upload your replays at http://wormolympics.com/upload, even if you lost. Not uploading replays is penalized.
> * Xrayez ==== Don't forget to report wins to MOD`Xrayez
> * Xrayez ==== Signups are open!
> * Xrayez ==== Signups are closed!

## How to use
1. After starting TSM, enter all required information about your tournament, then click Start button. Enter information about participants one-by-one, you can skip some of the fields. Then press <kbd>Enter</kbd> or 'Add' button. Whenever you enter a participant, the list of players in your clipboard is updated; if your tournament is 2v2 or 3v3, enter info as follows: Xrayez/Dude, che/dd, Ukraine/Dudeland, *
2. If you entered wrong information, delete the wrong item from the list by mouse left clicking on it.
3. During signups time you might want to post various type of messages to participants, including the list of players. Use the list of commands for that (such as <kbd>Ctrl+F1</kbd> to post a welcome message).
4. After signups, you might want to export the list of players into a text file. Use 'Export' button for that.
